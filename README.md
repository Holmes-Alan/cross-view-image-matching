two_stream: Code to train the two-stream baseline network.

joint_feature_learning: Code to jointly learn the features for ground panorama (query) and synthesized aerial from the query and also for aerial images. (Need to generate the aerial images first)

feature_fusion: Code to learn fused representations for ground panorama and synthesized aerial from ground to obtain robust query descriptor and the aerial image descriptor to use them for image matching.
