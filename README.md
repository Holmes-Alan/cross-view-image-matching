# cross-view-image-matching
Cross-view image matching: First, synthesize an aerial image from query ground level panorama and then, jointly learn its features with ground and aerial images to bridge the domain gap between cross-view images. Finally, fuse the learned representations for ground panorama and its transformed version (synthesized aerial image) to obtain robust query descriptor and use it for image matching.

Code Coming Soon!
